README for LuaCV
================

  What is LuaCV?
  --------------
  LuaCV is OpenCV library wrapper for Lua language. Main goal is to access fast 
  image processing library to light-weight, non-type language.
  Thanks to CMake project is a much easier to compile it under many OS platforms 
  which are currently supported by OpenCV.
  LuaCV is being developed as a master thesis at Brno University of Technology
  in Czech Republic.

  Availability
  ------------
  LuaCV is freely available for both academic and commercial purposes.
  See LICENSE for details. LuaCV can be downloaded from 
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/luacv

  Installation
  ------------
  LuaCV is implemented in C++ and can be compiled at all platforms that are 
  supported by OpenCV. Cmake is necessary for proper build, but you can always make
  your own Makefile to avoid it. See INSTALL for exact installation instructions.
  There is installer with binaries for Windows users available on sourceforge. 

  Samples
  -------
  There are sample scripts in directory sample/ which show basic usage of LuaCV
  wrapper. Most of them are copy of C/C++ samples from OpenCV rewritten to Lua.
  So if you want compare complexity of both version go to OpenCV directory/samples/c.
