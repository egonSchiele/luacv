INSTALL for LuaCV
=================

  Prerequisities
  -------------
    - C++ compiler
    - OpenCV >= 2.2.0
    - Lua    >= 5.1.4
    - Cmake  >  2.8.0

  Building LuaCV
  --------------
  LuaCV is built in the src directory, but the built process can be
  controlled from the top-level directory.
  
    Unix/Linux
    Building LuaCV on Unix-like systems should be very easy.
    First of all OpenCV, Lua and Cmake have to be installed in your system.
    If you have all of them, go to LuaCV root directory and run "cmake src".
    Cmake will generate all necessary files including Makefile. Once you have 
    Makefile, you can do "make". LuaCV library will be compiled to root directory 
    of project.

    Windows
    Building LuaCV on Windows is pretty dependent on your development kit.
    But Cmake can handle most of them. Just be sure to generate you project 
    with right generator. See "cmake --help" for them. After that you have to
    run "cmake -G YOUR_GENERATOR src" from project root folder. 
    Once you have generated project/makefile, you can build LuaCV in way used in 
    your ide.

  No backward compatity with OpenCV <=2.1.*
  ------------------------------------------
  Due to massive changes in OpenCV since 2.2.0 is not supported backward compatibility.
  Main reason is new module system which changed location of all functions in headers.

  Possible problems
  ----------------
  You can encounter an "Illegal instruction" problem in some cases. Just be sure 
  that your cpu supports SSE extensions. Or build OpenCV without them.

  If you see some segmentation fault, please send me a email at 
  jiri<dot>prymus<at>gmail<dot>com. I'm working on bug free code, but it's a huge goal.
