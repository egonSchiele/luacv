CHANGELOG for LuaCV
===================

  Changes in 0.2.0
  ----------------
    - Almost all OpenCV C API implemented.
    - Many new samples to test new functions.
    - Allocation bugs fixed.
    - OpenCV 2.3 compatibility.
    - Lua 5.2 compatibility.
    - NSIS MS Windows installer.
    - Partial documentation.

  Changes in 0.1.4
  ----------------
    - New allocation system for all objects (using boxed pointer). Big objects 
      like matrix and images aren't copied now. You can releas every object by
      obj=nil
      collectgarbage('collect')
      Releasing of objects is done by __gc callback with (cvFree/cvRelease* func).
    - Minor changes in LuaCV API to maximize optimalization by compiler (template
      functions, using aligned OpenCV alloc/free).
    - Some new types for image processing module (CvSubdiv2D*).
    - Implemented functions for CvGraph handling in core module.
    - Implemented various containters for imgproc modul.
    - Whole highgui C API is implemented (or almost all functions from C api).
    - Most of functions from imgproc C API module are implemented, but need proper 
      testing.
    - New samples in sample directory to test new implemented functions from imgproc
      module (almost all c api samples).
    - OpenCV callback functions for tracbars and mouse events are now fully implemented
      See functions CreateTrackbar and SetMouseCallback from highgui module or samples
      for basic usage.
    
  Changes in 0.1.3
  ----------------
    - Whole wrapper was rewritten to new OpenCV 2.2. It has to be done because of 
      new modular system in OpenCV. And that's why new LuaCV won't be 
      back compatibile with OpenCV < 2.2 .
